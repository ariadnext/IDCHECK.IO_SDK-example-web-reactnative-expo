AriadNEXT IDCHECK.IO SDK Web enables you to easily integrate a document capture and
identity verification workflow into your user onboarding or verification process, thanks to an
API and a widget.

This project is an example of an integration of the [idcheckio sdkweb](https://www.idcheck.io/) in a React Native App to easily integrate a document capture and identification solution in your user acquisition path.
